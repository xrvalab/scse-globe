    "about": [
      "After finishing my PhD at Bangor University, I pursued a Postdoctoral Research Associate position at Imperial College London researching nuclear materials. I then moved onto my current role, where I now work at EDF UK as a Fuel and Reactor Physics Research Engineer within the Nuclear R&D team.",
      "My experiences at Bangor were invaluable - from being able to volunteer in outreach events with the school and taking part in open days, to travelling to Hawaii with my research group to present at international conferences. I had full support during the 6 years I was at Bangor and felt fully equipped to move into the world of work.",
      "My advice to students coming to Bangor would be to enjoy it! 3 or 4 years go so fast, so make the most of every opportunity you are given. Get involved with the school's open day, or other extra-curricular events - it is a great way to meet more people and develop your interpersonal skills while studying."

      "Tasked with managing projects within a semiconductor manufacturing site mainly focusing on R&D, automation and industry 4.0 deployment.",
      "While at Bangor, the support I received from many lecturers was phenomenal. In particular Prof. Iestyn Pierce was absolutely adamant in making sure his students were given the support and tools to succeed, both on a technical level but more importantly on a human level. He was always ready to help, and was always happy to take the time to individually sit with students who asked for his help. Not only is the campus and Bangor itself beautiful, but also the staff truly do bring a sense of care and understanding to the university and the students therein.",
      "Do not be afraid to ask for help, whether it be in studies or in your personal life. In addition to that, don't focus on others' accomplishments, focus simply on being better than you were yesterday, everyone is on a different journey."
